🎧 VibeSync
Mood Based Music Recommendation System (Prototype)

VibeSync is a Python-based mood-driven music recommendation system that helps users discover music based on their emotional state through interactive features.

This project is a prototype, focused on logic, creativity, and user experience rather than complex frameworks.

🚀 Features

🎭 Mood Selector

📅 Mood of the Day

🎲 Surprise Me

🎵 Guess the Song

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Concepts: Functions, conditionals, lists, dictionaries

Approach: Rule-based recommendation system

🚧 Prototype & Future Scope

VibeSync can be enhanced using real-time music APIs.
For example, with the Last.fm API, the system could track user listening history, analyze song moods, and generate personalized recommendations automatically, transforming it into a data-driven recommendation platform.
